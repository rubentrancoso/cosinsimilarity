Software engineer

General
You would be kindly asked to create a recommendation engine from scratch for the problem described below.
Architectural background

To be able to manage our articles in an efficient way, we use attributes to describe all aspects of an article.

Product background

One of the challenges we’re facing, is finding the right product for our customers. They might search for something
very specific, but in some cases they cannot find it immediately, as we might have a lot of variations of a product
available.

That’s why we’re working on better product recommendations, to ensure we can make good proposals for our customers.

The task

We extract some article data and anonymized it. You can find the json file in the attached tgz file. Each article, 
identified by it’s sku, contains a set of attributes. Each attribute has an assigned value.

Out of this data, we want you to build an engine, which can calculate the similarity of articles. The similarity 
should be based on the attribute values. To get some ranking into the engine, we define the following:

An attribute which is higher in the alphabet, has to be weighted heavier, means att-a has an heavier weight than att-z.
The absolute weighting values can be chosen by you, as long as you maintain the described order.

The expected engine should use one sku as an input parameter, and output the 10 most similar skus including the 
calculated weights for them.

You can choose whichever language you’re most familiar with. The code should be structured and reuseable.
